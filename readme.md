This is a simple program developed to help stress engineers when post-processing results with the Freebody Loads Tool in MSC.Patran. It also features a GUI for a rapid deployment and execution of task. I have uploaded an executable `FLEX.exe` that you can download and run without the need of a compiler, it was created using  `pyinstaller` wtih the source code .py file.
